# vcf2loc

Convert VCF files generated by GBS pipelines like [GB-eaSy](https://github.com/dpwickland/GB-eaSy) or [TASSEL 5 GBSv2](https://bitbucket.org/tasseladmin/tassel-5-source/wiki/Tassel5GBSv2Pipeline) to the locus genotype file (loc-file) format used by [JoinMap](https://www.kyazma.nl/index.php/JoinMap/), which can be used to create linkage maps for experimental populations of diploid species.

Currently supports only the CP population type (cross between two heterogeneously heterozygous and homozygous diploid parents). Multiallelic sites are ignored and phasing is not supported.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.7 or higher. No installation or dependencies outside the Python standard library are required.

## Usage
You can run the vcf2loc.py script file directly:
```
./vcf2loc.py -t CP -a PARENT_A -b PARENT_B -o gbs_output.loc gbs_input.vcf
```
Or (particularly on Windows):
```
python vcf2loc.py -t CP -a PARENT_A -b PARENT_B -o gbs_output.loc gbs_input.vcf
```

As in the above example, you need to provide the script with the type of population, the sample names of the two parental samples (these should match their names in the VCF file header), an output file name, and an (uncompressed) VCF input file.

You can view a help message, which details these and other (optional) arguments, through ```./vcf2loc.py --help``` or ```python vcf2loc.py --help```.
